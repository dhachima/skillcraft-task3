# SkillCraft Internship – Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier

🚀 This project is part of my **Data Science Internship** at **SkillCraft Technology**.

## 📌 Task Objective

Build a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the **Bank Marketing Dataset** to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features such as age, job, marital status, previous campaign outcome, and more.

## 📊 Dataset Details

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Format**: CSV (semicolon-separated)  
- **Target Column**: `y` (yes/no – whether the customer subscribed)



## ✅ Steps Performed

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Checked null values, data types, and distributions

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`

3. **Model Building**
   - Used `DecisionTreeClassifier` from Scikit-learn

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score: **87.18%**
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

5. **Visualization**
   - Plotted the Decision Tree using `plot_tree()`
